*Apocalypse: The Second World War. (Image source: <https://www.amazon.com/Apocalypse-Second-World-Mathieu-Kassovitz/dp/B004H0M2SC>)*


[*Apocalypse: The Second World War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse:_The_Second_World_War) is a six-part French documentary about World War II. I was shocked but also intrigued by the images and videos that reconstruct the war scenes, and I spent a whole afternoon reviewing World War II using the documentary.

I was deeply impressed by the brutality of war and felt fortunate that we finally won that devastating war. Again, people on both sides are all victims of it. In reflection on it, here are my thoughts:

    Of course, one must be patriotic and cautious of outside influence. However, we shall be warier of the power of our government and should not be fooled by one seemingly admirable or kind action of the leaders. In the documentary, Hilter petted his puppy and looked amiable as a father, but such an image can never counteract his crime against humanity. As knowledgable and educated citizens of the community -- whether it's a university, country, or the world -- we shall be alert to populism and totalitarianism.
