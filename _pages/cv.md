Education
======
* Bachelor of Science, University of California, Los Angeles, 2023
  * Majors: Computer Science, Applied Mathematics
  * Cumulative GPA: 3.983 (out of 4)


Research Interests
=====
Machine Learning, Computational Genomics, and Machine Learning for Clinical Data.

My research interests lie in the intersection of Computer Science, Statistics, and Biology. Specifically, my goal is to develop interpretable and scalable Machine Learning methods for genetics and genomics data. As I am motivated to leverage computational tools and statistical models to solve real-world biomedical problems, my fields of interest also include Machine Learning for Clinical Data and Computational Genomics. 


Research and Intership
======
* Research Assistant, Machine Learning and Genomics Lab, Deparment of Computer Science, UCLA
  * October 2021 -- Present
  * Mentor: Professor Sriram Sankararaman
  * Description: I work on scalable and interpretable machine-learning methods for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in this lab. I have been involved in the project FastKAST: a fast kernel-based association testing method of non-linear genetic effects for Biobank-scale data; currently, I am developing a scalable nonparametric approach for feature contribution testing with Ph.D. candidate Boyang Fu.

* Member, the Junction of Statistics and Biology Lab, Department of Statistics, UCLA
  * September 2020 -- Present
  * Mentor: Professor Jingyi Jessica Li
  * Description: I benchmarked the methods of isoform abundance quantitative trait loci (isoform-QTL) under the guidance of Dr. Xinzhou Ge. In this project, I have built a robust pipeline to benchmark isoform-QTL and splicing-QTL methods using the GTEx read data from specific tissues. I also implemented Clipper: p-value-free FDR control on high-throughput data from two conditions in [Python](https://github.com/JSB-UCLA/Clipper-Python). 
  
Experiences and Activities
======
* Participant, UCLA Applied and Computational Mathematics REU Program
  * Summer 2022
  * Supervisors: Andrea Bertozzi, Jeffrey Brantingham, Junyuan Lin, Rishi Sonthalia
  * Description: I led the project Knowledge Graphs of the QAnon Twitter Network in the Computational and Applied Math REU program. We analyzed the QAnon Tweets dataset using co-occurrence graphs, topic modeling, time series analysis, and dynamic community detection. We also developed KG-labeled topics, a novel method for producing labeled topics with Knowledge Graph relations. I coordinated with different group members during the project, and were responsible for a significant part of results in the final paper submitted to the IEEE Big Data workshop on Knowledge Graph.
  
* Participant, Bruins-In-Genomics (B.I.G.) Summer Research Program
  * Summer 2021
  * Supervisor: Jingyi Jessica Li
  * Description: Bruins in Genomics Summer Research Program (2021) hosted by UCLA QCBio is a 8-week full-time immersion program for undergraduates interested in learning how to read and analyze genes and genomes. I learned data analysis in R, presented the method DORGE: Discovery of Oncogenes and tumoR suppressor genes using Genetic and Epigenetic features in a journal club, and reproduced the previous research results on benchmarking different methods of isoform abundance quantitative trait loci using simulated data.
