Education
======
* Bachelor of Science, University of California, Los Angeles, 2023
  * Majors: Computer Science, Applied Mathematics
  * Cumulative GPA: 3.983 (out of 4)
  
Research and Intership
======
* Research Assistant, Machine Learning and Genomics Lab, Deparment of Computer Science, UCLA
  * October 2021 -- Present
  * Supervisor: Professor Sriram Sankararaman
  * Description: I was involved in the project FastKAST, which is a fast kernel-based association testing method of non-linear genetic effects for Biobank-scale data; currently, I am developing an scalable nonparametric approach for feature contribution testing with Ph.D. student Boyang Fu.

* Member, the Junction of Statistics and Biology Lab, Department of Statistics, UCLA
  * September 2020 -- Present
  * Supervisor: Professor Jingyi Jessica Li
  * Description: I build, test and run the pipelines to benchmark isoform abundance quantitative trait loci (isoformQTL) and splicing QTL using GTEx reads data. I implemented Python-Clipper, a Python implementation of Clipper: p-value-free FDR control on high-throughput data from two conditions, and tried to integrate it to the MACS3 peaking calling method. I also have been attending weekly group meetings and the study group on explainable AI.
  
Experiences and Activities
======
* Participant, UCLA Applied and Computational Mathematics REU Program
  * Summer 2022
  * Supervisors: Andrea Bertozzi, Jeffrey Brantingham, Junyuan Lin, Rishi Sonthalia
  * Description: I took the lead in the project Knowledge Graphs of the QAnon Twitter Network in the Computational and Applied Math REU program. We analyzed the QAnon Tweets dataset using co-occurrence graphs, topic modeling, time series analysis, and dynamic community detection. We also porposed a new topic modeling method by incorporating information from the social network. I coordinated different group members during the project, and were responsible for most results in the final paper submitted to the IEEE Big Data workshop on Knowledge Graph.
  
* Participant, Bruins-In-Genomics (B.I.G.) Summer Research Program
  * Summer 2021
  * Supervisor: Jingyi Jessica Li
  * Description: Bruins in Genomics Summer Research Program (2021) hosted by UCLA QCBio: 8-week full-time immersion program for undergraduates interested in learning how to read and analyze genes and genomes. I learned data analysis in R, presented the method DORGE: Discovery of Oncogenes and tumoR suppressor genes using Genetic and Epigenetic features in a journal club, and reproduced the previous research results on benchmarking different methods of isoform abundance quantitative trait loci using simulated data.
