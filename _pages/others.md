### Q&A
* What are your hobbies?

  I enjoy reading books, especially those on history and politics in my free time. Several interesting history books I recommend are *Diplomacy* by Henry Kissinger, *Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow* by Yuval Noah Harari, *1587, a Year of No Significance: The Ming Dynasty in Decline* by Ray Huang. I also have developed an interest in Japanese Anime since my sophomore year. My favorite anime television series are *Sound! Euphonium* and *K-On!* produced by Kyoto Animation, and my favorite animated film is *Summer Wars* directed by Mamoru Hosoda. 

  I also play sports regularly. As an amateur badminton player, I have played badminton for more than 7 years. I also love running, as it is a good way to keep fit and it helps to release the pressures from schoolwork.


* As a student studying CS and Applied Math, why do you want to study CompBio and Bioinformatics?

  I am a community-oriented person and hope to serve the community using my domain knowledge. I was fascinated by Biology when I was taking Cell and Molecular Biology in my freshman year. With nearly the whole college years affected by COVID-19, I realize that our society's understanding of Biology isn't deep and comprehensive enough to protect us from viruses and diseases. These factors collectively helped me to choose Computational Biology and Bioinformatics as my field of study. So far, I enjoy the research in this field, especially when leveraging Mathematics, Statistics, and Machine Learning to solve real-world biomedical problems.

* What's your plan after graduation?

  I plan to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, or Computer Science with an emphasis on Computational Biology (probably after a Master's degree to gain more research experience). After that, I hope to work for a public-service institution (e.g., a hospital) as an independent researcher. In reflection on the obstacles in previous research experiences and the proof-based Honors Math courses I took, I enjoy the intellectual challenges in solving problems. Also, I am grateful for the help and opportunities offered by my mentors and collaborators. I would also like to share my intellectual outcomes with others and make a difference to a person, a community, or even society.
