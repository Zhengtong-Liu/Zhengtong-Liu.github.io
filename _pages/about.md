I am Zhengtong "Eric" Liu, a senior undergraduate student with double majors in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at UCLA. I am a candidate for Departmental Honors in Applied Math, and will receive Latin Honors (Summa Cum Laude) in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at graduation. Currently, I work as a research assistant in the [Machine Learning and Genomics Lab](https://sriramlab.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/) by Professor [Sriram Sankararaman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/) and an unofficial member of the [Junction of Statistics and Biology Lab](http://jsb.ucla.edu/) by Professor [Jingyi Jessica Li](http://jsb.ucla.edu/about-jingyi-jessica-li). I particpated in the [Bruins-In-Genomics Summer Research Program](https://qcb.ucla.edu/big-summer/big2021/) in Summer 2021, and led the Knowledge Graphs of QAnon Twitter Network project supervised by Professor [Andrea Bertozzi](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/) in the [UCLA Applied and Computational Mathematics REU Program](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/WORKFORCE/REU2022Topics.html) last summer.
